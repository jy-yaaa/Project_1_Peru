# Project_Peru
## ML for Econ
This project is a replication and extension of Hanna and Olkenâ€™s study about predicting per-capita consumption by using information of observable assets for per household in Peru. We add new assets features which are not used by Hanna and Olken and also create more than four thousands interactions specifically for Lasso. We use other machine learning techniques such as K-nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, Light Gradient Boosting Machine and Neural Network to predict the poverty status of households on the testing sample.
